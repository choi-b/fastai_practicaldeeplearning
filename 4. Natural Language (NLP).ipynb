    "    * hugging face is really good for NLP, well worth knowing\n",

    "    * Started out on Wikipedia data to predict the next word (got up to ~30% accuracy)\n",
    "    * Then applied to IMDB data, took the pre-trained model on wikipedia and ran a few more epochs, then took those weights and fine tuned them to classify a review as positive or negative\n",

    "* **Transformers** - took good really advantage of modern accelerators like Google TPUs\n",
